Before implementing hero selection, all of this must be done:

- properly handle connections error
    - client leave (warn others)
    - properly close client connections
    - server shutdown

- reject player while owner hasn't been logged in
- add delay before being able to try requesting again after being declined
- don't feed input when modal present @ joingame
