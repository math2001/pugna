Before implementing hero selection, all of this must be done:

- properly handle connections error
    - client leave (warn others)
    - properly close client connections
    - server shutdown

- Implement focus system for the GUI. Only the focused element should recieve
  the keyboard events.
- reject player while owner hasn't been logged in
- add delay before being able to try requesting again after being declined
- implement hover states for buttons
